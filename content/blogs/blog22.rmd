# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

Temperature anomalies base period: 1951-1980

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```




```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>%
  select(Year:Dec)%>% # selecting year and 12 month variables
  pivot_longer(cols=2:13, # converting dataframe to long format
               names_to ="Month",
               values_to = "delta")

glimpse(tidyweather)

```

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 



```{r scatter_plot, fig.width = 12}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")), # add columns date, month and year
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point(size = 0.8, color = "royalblue")+ # add points
  geom_smooth(color="red") + # add trendline
  theme_economist_white() +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  labs ( # change titles and axis names
    title = "Weather Anomalies",
    subtitle = "Temperature deviations have increased since 1880",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Temperature deviation (°C)", caption = "Data From NASA"
  ) + theme(axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -2,size=14, face = "italic", color = "firebrick"), #adjust axis
            axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 3,size=14, face = "italic", color = "firebrick")) + #adjust axis
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "20 years", labels = date_format("%Y")) #axis formatting

```

## Temperature Increase Differences Across Months

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? 

Overall, it appears that the effect of increasing temperature is more pronounced in February, March, April and October. Potential explanations for the increase in February, March and April may include the significant drop in Northern Hemisphere snow cover and Arctic sea ice during these months, which helps reflect heat from the sunlight. In addition, variable ocean salinity and temperature affects weather patterns leading to anomalous storm formation which further affects temperature.


```{r facet_wrap, fig.width = 12}
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point(size = 0.8, color = "royalblue")+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  facet_wrap(vars(month)) + # show each month individually
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(), # remove background
        strip.background = element_blank() # remove chart title formatting for better readability
        ) +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies",
    subtitle = "More pronounced increases in fall and spring",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Temperature deviation (°C)",
    caption = "Data from NASA"
  )+theme(axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -2,size=14, face = "italic", color = "firebrick"), #adjust axis
            axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 3,size=14, face = "italic", color = "firebrick"))  #adjust axis


```


## Data by Decade


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```


```{r density_plot, fig.width = 12}

  )+theme(axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -2,size=14, face = "italic", color = "firebrick"), #adjust axis
            axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 3,size=14, face = "italic", color = "firebrick"))  #adjust axis

```

## Annual Anomalies 

```{r averaging, fig.width = 12}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(
    annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x = year, y = annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point(size = 1.1)+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(color = "red")+

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1880,2020,20)) #axis ticks formatting


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

```


Overall, it appears that the confidence interval for the average annual delta is between 1.01 and 1.11 degrees for 2011-present using the formula and between 1.02 and 1.11 degrees using bootstrapping. This means that if we were to take sufficient random samples from the population, we can expect the confidence intervals to contain the true population mean approximately 95% of the time. The formula for computing the confidence interval is the mean delta - / + critical t-value for n-1 * standard error of delta. The bootstrapping consists of generating a bunch of bootstrap samples, finding the mean of each sample, and creating a distribution of the sample statistics of which the 95% confidence interval is the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution. The sampling within the bootstrap samples is done with replacement.

# Global warming and political views (GSS)

[A 2010 Pew Research poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/10/27/wide-partisan-divide-over-global-warming/) asked 1,306 Americans, "From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"

In this exercise we analyze whether there are any differences between the proportion of people who believe the earth is getting warmer and their political ideology. As usual, from the **survey sample data**, we will use the proportions to estimate values of *population parameters*.


```{r, read_global_warming_pew_data}
global_warming_pew <- read_csv(here::here("content","blogs", "global_warming_pew.csv"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".


```{r}
global_warming_pew %>% 
  count(party_or_ideology, response)
```

We will be constructing four 95% confidence intervals to estimate population parameters, for the % who believe that **Earth is warming**, according to their party or ideology.

```{r}
global_warming_ci <- global_warming_pew %>% 
  filter(response != "Don't know / refuse to answer") %>% # get rid of undecided answers
  group_by(party_or_ideology) %>%
  count(party_or_ideology, response)
  prop.test(248, 798, conf.level = .95) #For Cons Repub
  prop.test(405, 428, conf.level = .95) #For Lib Dem
  prop.test(563, 721, conf.level = .95) #Mod/Cons Dem
  prop.test(135, 270, conf.level = .95) #Mod Lib Repub
  
```
## Political Ideology and Global Warming 

Does it appear that whether or not a respondent believes the earth is warming is independent of their party ideology? You may want to  read on [The challenging politics of climate change](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-challenging-politics-of-climate-change/)

Whether respondents believe the earth is warming due is not independent of their party ideology. There seems to be a strong relationship with conservatism and not believing in climate science. The more liberal respondents are, the more likely it is they believe in climate change. The reasons for this could be constant false information by networks like Fox News, general distrust in government institutions on the right and economic interests.
