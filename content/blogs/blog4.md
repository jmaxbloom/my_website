Today and last night were **Yom Kippur** a time for reflection and repentance. Now that I'm able to use the internet again, I've put together a reflection for my past few months. This will be done somewhat stream of conscious.

- Actually celebrating Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur this year have let me feel closer to home.

- I belong more at LBS than I did at Berkeley

- I'm not sure if I'm going to stay in Europe long term but it's been fun enough for now

- People wear a crazy amount of Tommy Hilfiger here. Why? We don't even wear it in the US? I saw someone wearing Abercrombie and Fitch also. Are they even Abercrombie and Fitch anymore if they've turned down the sex factor.

-How can I begin building roots here? 

- I need stop catastrophizing about job related things and give myself a break. Maybe take a day in a sensory deprivation chamber. 

-I have been committing more to work than at Berkeley and that is a step in the right direction
