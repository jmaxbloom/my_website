<h3>Key observations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In total, there are <strong>74 variables/columns</strong> and <strong>6,046 observations/rows</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>numeric variables</strong> in our dataset include: <em>id, scrape_id, host_id, host_listings_count, host_total_listings_count, latitude, longitude, accommodates, bedrooms, beds, minimum_nights, maximum_nights, minimum_minimum_nights, maximum_minimum_nights, minimum_maximum_nights, maximum_maximum_nights, minimum_nights_avg_ntm, maximum_nights_avg_ntm, availability_30, availability_60, availability_90, availability_365, number_of_reviews, number_of_reviews_ltm, number_of_reviews_l30d, review_scores_rating, review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness, review_scores_checkin, review_scores_communication, review_scores_location, review_scores_value, calculated_host_listings_count, calculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes, calculated_host_listings_count_private_rooms, calculated_host_listings_count_shared_rooms, reviews_per_month</em></li>
<li>The variables that are <strong>categorical or factors</strong> (or can be transformed into them) include: <em>Host location, host response time, host_is_superhost, host_neighbourhood, host_verifications, host_has_profile_picture, host_identity_verified, neighbourhood, neighbourhood_cleansed, property_type, room_type, bathrooms_tex, amenities, has_availability, instant_bookable</em> are categorial or factor variables. Some of these variables will be reduced to fewer (mutually exclusive) options</li>
<li><em>Price, host_response_rate</em> and <em>host_acceptance_rate</em> <strong>should be numeric but have been stored as a character</strong>. Before computing the summary statistics or finding NAs, we will <strong>transform these variables into numeric ones</strong></li>
<li>Some of the variables will be <strong>less meaningful</strong> (or practically impossible to incorporate) for our analysis and can be excluded from our dataset. More specifically, <em>id, listing_url, scrape_id, last_scraped, name, description, neighborhood_overview, picture_url, host_id, host_url, host_name, host_about, host_thumbnail_url, host_picture_url, host_verifications, minimum_minimum_nights, maximum_minimum_nights, minimum_maximum_nights, maximum_maximum_nights, calendar_updated, calendar_last_scraped, first_review, last_review</em> <strong>are eliminated</strong></li>

<h3>Key observations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There appear to be quite a <strong>few missing values</strong> in several variables. The variables with the lowest “complete rate” are <em>neighborhood, first_review, last_review, review_scores_rating, review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness, review_scores_checkin, review_scores_communication, review_scores_location, review_scores_value, reviews_per_month</em></li>
<li>A first glimpse at the histograms that are shown for the numeric variables, show that most numeric variables are either <strong>skewed to the left</strong> or <strong>skewed to the right</strong>. Our main variable of interest, price, appears to be skewed to the right. In the data wrangling section, this variable will undergo <strong>log transformation</strong> to correct for this skewness</li>
<li>The dataset contains a few <strong>unusual observations</strong>. For example, there is an observation which accommodates 0 people, another observation with 0 beds, a price of 0, and 0 host listings. In the data wrangling section, we will <strong>eliminate some of these observations</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="creating-informative-visualisations" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating informative visualisations</h2>
<p>First, we will <strong>transform price</strong> into a new variable price_4_nights, decide whether it should be <strong>transformed to a logarithm</strong>, and change some <strong>categorical variables into fewer variables</strong>. Next, we will consider the <strong>correlation between variables</strong>. Rather than creating visualisations for all 51 variables, we will only create visualisations for the variables that are intuitively related to the price of a listing and are likely to be included in our regression model</p>
<div id="price" class="section level3">
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>For ease of analysis, we will <strong>create a price for 4 nights variable</strong> since that is the objective of this study</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Creating the price per 4 nights
reduced_listings &lt;- reduced_listings %&gt;%
mutate(price_4_nights = (price*4))</code></pre>
<p>Next, we will <strong>inspect the distribution</strong> of the variables</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Distribution of price_4_nights
ggplot(reduced_listings, aes(x = price_4_nights)) +
  geom_density()+
  labs(title = &quot;Price per 4 nights&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Density&quot;,
       x = &quot;Price per 4 nights&quot;,
       y = &quot;Number of listings&quot;) +
  theme_economist_white()+theme(axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r=3)),axis.title.x = element_text(margin=margin(t=3)))+
  NULL</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/HK_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" />
Given the distribution of price_4_nights, it appears that the the price_4_nights variable is <strong>skewed to the right</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>correct</strong> for this, we can <strong>log transform</strong> the variable to create a normal distribution, which will help with analysis and regression</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Creating the log(price per 4 nights)
reduced_listings &lt;- reduced_listings %&gt;%
mutate(log_price_4_nights=log(price_4_nights))

# Check distribution of data

# Distribution of log_price_4_nights
ggplot(reduced_listings, aes(x = log_price_4_nights)) +
  geom_density()+
  labs(title = &quot;Log price per 4 nights&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Density&quot;,
       x = &quot;Log price per 4 nights&quot;,
       y = &quot;Number of listings&quot;) +
  theme_economist_white()+ theme(axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r=3)),axis.title.x = element_text(margin=margin(t=3)))+

<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_density).</code></pre>

The distribution is exactly as expected. <em>Entire condos and entire rental units</em> have the <strong>highest median prices</strong>. <em>Private rooms in a rental unit</em> are naturally the <strong>cheapest listings</strong>. As we grouped the remaining values of the variables in “Other”, there are many extreme outliers in this group.</p>

Overall, the boxplot shows many outliers with high prices for all neighbourhoods. As we expected, listings on <em>islands</em> have the <strong>highest median price</strong>. These should be more exotic locations for more affluent travelers with higher real estate prices. <em>Wan Chai</em> is one of the busiest commercial areas in Hong Kong. The buildings are tall, the apartments small and hence the prices for Airbnb apartments are also on the <strong>lower end</strong>.</p>

No surprises to see here. <em>One shared bathroom</em> clearly corresponds to the <strong>lowest price</strong>.

Many of the <strong>review variable</strong>s exhibit <strong>high correlation and linear relationships</strong> with each other. Especially <em>review_score_value, review_score_rating and review_score_cleanliness</em> exhibit correlation. To <strong>avoid multicollinearity</strong> in our model, we decided to <strong>only use one of them</strong>. At first we used <em>review_scores_cleanliness</em> because it has the <strong>highest correlation with price</strong>. Later on in the process, we decided to use <em>number_of_reviews</em> instead, as it <strong>increased the explanatory power</strong> of our model and <strong>fits better logically</strong></p>

There is <strong>some correlation</strong> among the numerical values. <em>Number of accomodates</em> and <em>bedrooms</em> show a <strong>positive significant correlation of 0.5</strong>. This was expected as more accomodates require more beds and bedrooms. The other <strong>notable correlation</strong> we found was between <em>host acceptance rate</em> and <em>number of reviews</em>. This relationships also makes sense. The more guests a hosts accepts, the more reviews they will get.</p>

Some features of the categorical variables <strong>seem to be correlated</strong>. <em>Entire rental units</em> often feature <em>1 bathroom</em>, so do entire service apartments. <em>Private rooms in a rental unit</em> often have only a <em>shared bathroom</em>, which is what you would expect. Apartments in the area <em>Yau Tsim Mong</em> tend to have <em>one private bathroom</em>. The other results do not tell us much. Ignore all correlation coefficients for mutually exclusive variables. Obviously, the property type <em>private room in rental unit</em> is <strong>heavily correlated</strong> with the room <em>type private room</em></p>

Across numerical and categorical variables, there is <strong>limited correlation</strong>. <em>Accomodates (numerical)</em> and <em>1 shared bathroom (categorical)</em> exhibit <strong>slightly negative correlation</strong>. On the other hand, the <strong>correlation</strong> with <em>2 bathrooms</em> is <strong>positive</strong>. This is what you would expect. The larger the number of accomodates, the more bathrooms there are. <em>Accomodates</em> is also <strong>negatively correlated</strong> to <em>private rooms</em> and <strong>positively correlated</strong> to <em>entire rental units</em>. Again, the same argument about size applies. In terms of geographical location, the <em>Islands neighbourhood</em> shows the <strong>highest correlation</strong> with <em>accomodates</em>. We expect the islands to be among the most expensive and largests domiciles and hence with the largest number of accomodates. The neighbourhood <em>Wan Chai shows</em> the <strong>highest negative correlation</strong> with <em>number of reviews</em>. This is perhaps a sign that Wan Chai is one of the most heavily populated areas with more listings than in demand.</p>

Here, we used some charts to visualise some <strong>important values</strong>, we expect to have a great influence on the price. It also allows us to <strong>identify outliers (e.g. host response rate of 0%, number of accomodates &gt; 16)</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>most common number of minimum nights</strong> is <em>1</em>, followed by <em>29, 30, 28, 2, 3</em> and <em>7</em>. Out of this list, the numbers <em>29, 30 and 28</em> <strong>clearly stand out</strong>. These “long-term” Airbnb bookings are different from a regular short-term booking, and are very likely to be a lease or sublet.</p>
<p>Since observations with a <strong>minimum of more than 4 nights</strong> would <strong>not be feasible</strong> for a model that predicts the price for four nights, these have been <strong>filtered out</strong>. As mentioned in the EDA, <strong>observations with a price of 0</strong> and <strong>accommodates of 0 will be eliminated</strong>. Although one can argue that a maximum_nights of at least 4 nights could be added as a criteria, we have argued against it as someone can make a new booking with the new listing to prolong his or her stay</p>

<p>The coefficient of <em>review_scores_rating</em> is <strong>-6.398</strong>. This means that the <strong>price per 4 nights</strong> will <strong>decrease by 6.398 USD</strong> if one extra review is written about the listing. The coefficient is significant at p=0.05.</p>
<p>The variable prop_type_simplified is divided among five categories (<em>Private room in rental unit, Entire rental unit, Entire condominium (condo), Entire serviced apartment and other</em>). In model 1, <em>entire condominium (condo)</em> is chosen as the <strong>baseline variable</strong>. The coefficient of each property type, can be interpreted as the USD change if the property type changes from an entire condominium (condo) to the property type of the coefficient. Given the fact that none of the dummy variables for property types is significant, the <em>property type</em> does <strong>not appear to be a predictor of airbnb prices</strong> per 4 nights in this model</p>

<p>The base level is <em>entire home/apartment</em>, and the remaining categories are <em>hotel room, private room, and shared room</em>. Choosing a <em>hotel room or private room</em> is <strong>significant at the 5% level</strong>, and choosing a <em>shared room</em> is <strong>significant at the 1% level</strong>. The way to interpret these is that the price per 4 nights will decrease by USD 2858 for a hotel room compared to an entire home apartment in a condo. Similarly, the price for a private room is USD 1766 less compared to an entire home/apartment, and USD 3400 less for a shared room, which follows logic that shared rooms would be the cheapest.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this assignment, we will use the <strong>log_price_4_nights</strong> variable instead of price_4_nights. Since <em>prop_type_simplified</em> and <em>number_of_reviews</em> were insignificant, we will remove them from the next model. First, we will check whether the <em>number of bathrooms, bedrooms, beds, or size of the house (accomodates)</em> are significant predictors. We will also check whether these are <strong>co-linear variables</strong>. The reasoning for this is that in the correlation matrix, these seemed to have a significant correlation with the dependent variable of price.</p>

<p>It appears that the <em>bathrooms, bedrooms and accommodates</em> are <strong>significant variables</strong>. Surprisingly, there is <strong>no co linearity</strong> between these variables (since the VIF is lower than 5). Also, adopting a log price model helps increase the <strong>explanatory power of the model to 38%</strong>. It also increases the significance of the variables. Given that the dependent variable is log transformed, the <strong>interpretation of coefficients changes</strong>. As before, the room type affects the price per 4 nights and having a shared room decreases the price. The new independent variables controls for the number of baths, beds, and the people that can be accommodated. There are a few noteworthy points</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Beds and accommodates</em> are <strong>not correlated</strong> in the model, even though generally the number of beds should be related to the max people that can be accommodated</li>
<li>For an accommodation, in an <em>entire room/apartment</em>, in a <em>condo property type</em>, having <em>2 baths</em> <strong>increases the price per 4 nights by 33%</strong></li>
<li>For every <em>extra bedroom</em> in <em>an entire room/apartment in a condo</em>, the <strong>price per 4 nights increases by 12%</strong> (We get this by (exp(.12) -1)*100 )</li>
<li>For <em>every additional person</em> that the listing can <em>accommodate</em>, the <strong>price per 4 nights increases by 7.4%</strong></li>

<p>The <em>instant_bookable</em> variable is <strong>significant at p=0.01</strong>. It appears that a price premium is paid if a listing is instantly bookable. This follows, as the convenience of being able to book instantly would push people to be willing to spend higher. The model also now <strong>explains 40%</strong> of the data. The way to interpret the coefficient on a <em>property being bookable</em> is that for an entire apartment/house <strong>increases the price by 31%</strong> as opposed to a property that is not instantly bookable.</p>

<p>Overall, the <em>neighborhood</em> has a <strong>significant impact</strong> on the price per 4 nights. The new model, which controls for whether or not the property has <em>important amenities, the number of host listings, and the type of neighborhood</em>, <strong>explains 53% of the variability in data</strong>. The new independent variables are <strong>all significant at the 1% level</strong>. The base <em>neighborhood</em> is <em>Central &amp; Western</em> and the interpretation on the coefficients is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For a property that has <em>important amenities</em>, the definition of which has been given above, <strong>the price per 4 nights increases by 14%</strong></li>
<li>If a property has an <em>additional review</em>, strangely, <strong>the price per 4 nights decreases by .10%</strong>. This could be explained by the fact that an additional review doesn’t mean it is a positive review. An additional review could bring down the rating, which could bring down the price.</li>
<li>If the <strong>host acceptance rate increases by 1%</strong>, the <strong>price per 4 nights</strong> of an entire house/apartment in <em>Central and Western</em> <strong>decreases by .18%</strong></li>
<li>If the <em>number of listings a host has</em> <strong>increase by 1</strong>, <strong>the price per 4 nights decreases by .12%</strong></li>
<li>Living in an entire <em>house/apartment in any neighborhood</em>, except for the <em>Islands</em>, will <strong>decrease the price for 4 nights by 13%</strong>. Living in the <em>Islands</em> <strong>increases the price for 4 nights by 22%</strong>, meaning that Central and Western is the 2nd most expensive neighborhood</li>

<p>Overall, it appears that <em>availability_30</em> is <strong>not a predictor of log prices</strong>, since it is insignificant. For the remainder of this project, we will <strong>use model 6 as our best model</strong> because of the adjusted R2 and significance of variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="residuals" class="section level3">
<h3>Residuals</h3>
<p>To check the robustness of our established model, model6, we run a series of diagnostic tests.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>autoplot(model6)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/HK_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png" width="672" />
Since the QQ plot shows that the <strong>residuals don’t follow a normal distribution</strong>, we <strong>cannot use msummary to establish the interpretation of coefficients</strong> as we need a more <strong>robust estimator</strong> for our t-tests and confidence intervals. However, OLS is still the <strong>BLUE.</strong> To double check this, we run a <em>Shapiro W Test and a Breusch - Pagan t test</em>. The null hypothesis for the shapiro test is that the residuals follow a normal distribution and the null for the Breusch Pagan is that the data is homoskedastic.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>shapiro.test(model6$residuals)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Shapiro-Wilk normality test

<p>We <strong>reject the null hypothesis of normality at the 1% level</strong> and <strong>reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity at the 1% level</strong> . Thus, to get robust estimates of the coefficients, we use a robust t test. We selected the <strong>HC0</strong> type as the other types are more effective for small samples.</p>

We can see from the co-plot the varying distributions across different neighbourhoods. We can see that across the plots that <strong>Yau Tsim Mong</strong> tends to have more high accommodation airbnbs. We also see a spike in higher price airbnbs in the <strong>Other</strong> and <strong>Islands</strong> neighbourhood. For the amenities, we see that there are generally more <strong>high amenity</strong> airbnbs across the neighbourhoods and an increase in number of larger places as amenities increases.</p>

<p>We can use the above data to <strong>predict the price for 4 nights</strong> based on different parameters. The <strong>cheapest type of room</strong> would be a <em>private room, with a private bath, one bedroom, that accommodates 2, in Yau Tsim Mong</em>. The property is <em>instantly bookable, has 3 important amenities, with a verified host who has 5 listings, 100 reviews, and accepts bookings 100% of the time</em>. The price per night for this type of property is USD530, which means <strong>the price for 4 nights is USD2120</strong>.</p>
<p>Conversely, the <strong>most expensive accommodation</strong> is a <em>private room with 2 baths, 2 bedrooms, that accommodates 5, is instantly bookable with 3 important amenities located in a neighbourhood outside the most popular 3 (Yau Tsim Mong, Islands, Wan Chai)</em>. <em>The host’s identity is verified, has 1 listing, has received 21 reviews, and accepts bookings 25% of the time</em>. The price per night is USD 925, and <strong>the price per 4 nights is USD3700</strong></p>
<p>When compared to the official prices as listed on AirBnB, the property prices per night are USD 514, 617, 411, 1554, and 1029 respectively. We can see that the <strong>prices for the properties</strong> are <strong>skewed towards the higher end of the CI</strong>, which could be explained by the heteroskedasticity of the data as well as the fact that COVID might have had an impact on the data used in the model, whereas latest prices have significantly changed since then.</p>
<p>The range of the 95% confidence interval indicates that over multiple experiments, we can expect the price per night to fall between $400 to $1065 95% of the time. When it comes to the predictive power of the model, all of the actual prices fall between the confidence interval, bar one. This is potentially because of the heteroscedastic data and the fact that the latest prices and norms have changed as a result of COVID. A key point is that our model predicts prices for types of houses that fall somewhere in between the price range for the time period we used. This means for anyone looking for budget accommodation or high-end accommodation (extremities), the model won’t necessarily predict accurately.</p>
