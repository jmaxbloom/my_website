# Returns of portfolio

Lets input our ticker vector based on what I'm invested in. This analysis assumes I bought everything at the same time as Schwab won't let me export individual data points.

```{r, tickers}

tickers <- c("AAPL","AZN","BWXT","BRK","CRWD","DNN","DLR","ICE","MSFT","MRNA","NXE","HOOD","CRM","URA")

sp <- "^GSPC"
```




```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2020-10-10",
         to = "2021-10-10") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

market <- sp %>%
  tq_get(get = "stock.prices",
         from = "2020-10-10",
         to = "2021-10-10")%>%
  group_by(symbol)


```

To determine the alpha and performance of my portfolio, I must look into the returns on a stock basis and on an aggregate one. I only care about the total return over the past year.


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
 
#Total returns
myStocks_returns_total <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select = adjusted,mutate_fun = periodReturn,period = "daily", type = "arithmetic",col_rename = "Return", cols = c(nested.col))%>%
  summarise(return = prod(1+Return)-1)

#Market Returns
market_return <- market %>%
  tq_transmute(select = adjusted,mutate_fun = periodReturn,period = "yearly", type = "arithmetic",col_rename = "Return", cols = c(nested.col))%>%
  summarise(return = prod(1+Return)-1)
head(myStocks_returns_total,13)
```

```{r, risk_return, echo=FALSE}

#Schwab gave me my percentage weights of my portfolio, hardcoded them in
myStocks_returns_total$weight <- c(.099,.005,.045,.13,.077,.049,.034,.123,.208,.116,.033,.01,.071)
#pulled from Yahoo Finance
myStocks_returns_total$beta <- c(1.22,0.18,1.01,1.04,1.33,2,0.2,0.73,1.49,0.8,1.61,1.74,1.18)
#to adjust for me not holding the stocks for the full year
myStocks_returns_total$actuals <- c(.3036,.0714,.0775,.4804,.4238,.0694,.4667,-.3519,.3813,3.1704,.4358,.3048,1.52)
myStocks_returns_total%>%
  summarize(PV_Return = sum(weight*return),PV_True = sum(weight*actuals),beta = sum(weight*beta))%>%mutate(alpha = (PV_Return - .015)-beta*(market_return$return-.015),true_alpha = (PV_True - .015)-beta*(market_return$return-.015)) %>% kableExtra::kable(output = "html",color = "black", background = "lightgrey") %>% kableExtra::kable_classic()%>%kableExtra::column_spec(c(1:5), color = "Black", background = "lightgrey")%>%kableExtra::row_spec(0,background = "lightgray")


```
Now I didn't invest in everything 1 year ago. But if I did, my alpha would be *43.1%* which is very high. This analysis doesn't include my BRK.B stocks which, thus changes the analysis. Including that stock, I have an alpha closer to *20%*.
