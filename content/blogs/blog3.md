Recently I have undertaken the task of deigning to build upon my general repertoire of literary influences. Some of these readings have been for enrichment, others for entertainment, and others more to sustain a general knowledge base of the American literary canon (works that I believe I should read). Here is a list of of the works that I have been reading.

- *The Prince* by Niccolo Machiavelli
- *The Divine Comedy* by Dante Alighieri 
- *Paradise Lost* by John Milton
- *Mountain Interval* by Robert Frost
- *The Mound* by H. P. Lovecraft

*The Prince* is a book written about ruling over principalities and serves as a case study in the triumphs and failures of Western European empire expansion. While one of the main point Machiavelli hammered in was that to take over one's opponent's dynasty, you have to kill their entire extended family, there were plenty of other lessons more applicable to the modern day. 

On raising strangers to power:
> > That he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that pre-dominancy has been brough about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power

On the folly of relying on your advisers (Trump's entire campaign):
> > That a prince who is not wise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his affairs entirely to one ... prudent man...he may be well governed...such a governor would in a short time take away his state from him

*The Divine Comedy* is a critique on the state of affairs in Florence during the time of Dante Alighieri. While I am generally unable to grasp the criticism of the Italian city as my Italian history knowledge is lacking, the landscape Dante paints is quite interesting. It is also quite funny that the premise of the story is that he is cornered by a beast in the wild and so the spirit of a woman he barely knows sends a guide to take him through hell, heaven, and purgatory.  


*Paradise Lost* was a book I read a bit of in high school and wanted to finish. Unfortunately, the middle bit was excruciatingly meandering and boring and I was unable to make it through. However, the beginning gave me two bits of interesting things to ponder about. The first is the question of it is better to rule in hell or serve in heaven. I would, personally, rather rule in hell. The second is that, albeit most likely unintentionally, G-d is portrayed as a bit of a jerk in the way he demands a sacrifice from his host or will damn all of humanity because of Lucifer's interactions. That was my interpretation at least.

*Mountain Interval* is a collection of poems by Robert Frost. The first one is the oft misunderstood *The Road not Taken* which is really about indecision and the lack of change difference it makes between two equally unimportant decisions. I would also recommend checking out *A Patch of Old Snow* and *Putting in the Seed* for its imagery.

*The Mound* is the final book on my list. While I primarily read it for my love of cosmic horror and the works of H. P. Lovecraft, *The Mound* provided an interesting critique of an overly pleasure seeking society. In the book, there exists a society below a plateau in the deserts of the US where people have evolved to the point of not having any work and focusing solely on pleasure. However, the infinitude of pleasure they have obtained has led them to devolve into a cruelly libertine society.
