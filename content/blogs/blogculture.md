When I got the news that I would be attending LBS, I was ecstatic about getting to meet tons of new people from different cultures. I went to college in an environment with a hugely diverse culture. But, what I didn't grasp was that despite all of the diverse ethnicities of the people I matriculated with, was that we were often united by growing up in relatively diverse environments (as America is a mixing pot). I didn't take this into account originally and assumed that everyone else had extensive experience interacting with different cultures. I did learn that many of the people here grew up in relatively homogeneous environments. Luckily, I attended high school in a place where I was a minority and was able to somewhat ingratiate myself within that culture. I used my experience doing that and my experience interacting with so many different groups to provide social lubrication and build many relationships here at LBS.
